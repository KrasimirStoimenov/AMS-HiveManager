# AMS-HiveManager - Server
## [SoftUni Practice Server](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server)

## Usage
This is **REST service**, created for educational purposes. To execute it, open a command prompt and run `node server.js`.

To run the server on your local machine, follow these steps:

  - **Navigate to the server directory (in new terminal)**
     ```bash
     cd server

  - **Run the server**
     ```bash
     node server.js

**The server should now be running on http://localhost:3030.**

Note that changes to the data **will not be persisted**! All operations happen in memory and will be wiped when the service is restarted.
